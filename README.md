## Overview

This script calculates the negative acceleration of a vehicle using the kinematic formula. It allows you to specify the initial velocity, final velocity, and a range of distances, and it will compute and display the negative acceleration for those distances.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Usage
   1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/engin-batuhan/acceleration-calculator.git
   ```
   2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd acceleration-calculator/acceleration_calculation
   ```
   3. Open the acceleration_calculator.py file and set the desired initial velocity, final velocity, and the range of distances you want to calculate acceleration for.
   4. Run the script: 
   ```sh
   python3 acceleration_calculation.py
   ```
   5. The script will calculate the acceleration
